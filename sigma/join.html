<h4> Welcome to Join Us :-) </h4>
<br>
<p>
 	We always look for excellent people -- PhDs and undergrads -- to join our group.  Like  other CS researchers, the main requirements for conducting research in our lab are: (1) <b>Self-motivated</b>. You will not be able to learn much here if you do not motivate yourself or cannot devote much time; (2) <b>Strong mathematical background</b>. We are interested in developing principled and rigorous techniques; (3) <b>Good programming skills</b> (well, self explanatory).
</p>

<br>
<dl>
  				<dt><b>Interested in working with us? Please read the following</b>: </dt>
<div style="line-height:40%;"><br></div>

    				<dd>-- <b> For undergrads and master students at UChicago</b>: Since the requests we received are many more than what we could accommodate, these days we usually can only accept student RA requests from those who have taken my upper-level courses, such as <a href="https://frkoehle.github.io/data37200-w2025/">machine learning</a> and <a href="https://www.haifeng-xu.com/cmsc35401win24/index.htm">computational economics</a>. If you have taken any of these classes, and are interested in our lab's research, please feel free to contact me.         
 <!--
Our lab regularly host undergrad and master research assistants. If you are interested, please fill this <a href="https://forms.gle/LaKXRsMZgjAG3zbw8">Google Form</a> to initiate the conversation and describe your research interest. We usually respond within a week to those whose backgrounds match our ongoing projects (though keep in mind that we could not accommodate all requests due to fitness reasons). There is no need to email me since we will ask you to fill the form first anyway.
--> 
Notably, all the undergrad RAs in our group are expected to lead research projects and publish at premium CS conferences (most of our past undergrad RAs did  successfully achieve these goals). </dd>
<div style="line-height:40%;"><br></div>

<dd>-- <b>PhD Applicants</b>: We always look for excellent PhD candidates. If you are interested, please apply to the <a href="https://cs.uchicago.edu/academics/admission/?phd"> UChicago CS PhD program</a> or <a href="https://codas.uchicago.edu/how-to-apply/"> UChicago Data Science PhD</a>, and indicates your interest in working with me. If you feel it might be helpful to drop me a line, please feel free to do so and I usually try my best to respond to those requests that are truly relevant.</dd>
<div style="line-height:40%;"><br></div>


				<dd>-- <b>Visitors & Summer Interns</b>: Our group occasionally host visitors or interns. However, unless for truly exceptional special cases,  we usually only host visitors who   already have paper publication experience, or have recommendations from researchers whom I know. Please indicate these requirements in your email request (attach/link your published papers); otherwise I may not be able to respond due to large amount of requests. </dd>
