	<!-- <b>Prerequisites:</b> The pre-requisitive for CIS 322 is CIS 212 or equivalent. You may take CIS 322 concurrently with CIS 314 or CIS 313. It is preferable to take CIS 322 before CIS 330 and CIS 415, although it is not a pre-requisite. Students at the 400 level may take CIS 322, but you should be aware that the course is designed primarily for students at the 300 level.<br/><br/> -->

  <h3>Course Description</h3>
<p>Welcome! This is a PhD-level course covering topics at the interface between machine learning and economics. In many economic applications, the problem either is too complex or has much uncertainty. In such cases, machine learning approaches help to design more realistic or practical algorithms. Conversely, in many application of machine learning, the algorithms have to interact with economic agents, such as  self-interested data suppliers whose objectives are not aligned with the algorithm or human content creators (e.g., Youtubers) who  are now challenged by generative AI technology. These problems form an intriguing interplay between machine learning and economics, and have attracted a lot of recent research attention. This course will discuss several recent research directions in this space. Our goal is to cover (some selected) basic results in the following four directions. Alone the way, we will also cover necessary basics such as game theory, learning theory and information economics. 
</p>


<p>Topics covered in this course, and tentative syllabus: </p>
<ul>
	<li>First Half: Machine Learning for Economic Problems 
	<ul>
		<li> (week 1) Linear programming and duality</li>
		<li> (week 2-3) Intro to game theory, zero-sum games</li>
		<li> (week 3-4) No regret learning and its convergence to equilibrium</li>
		<li> (week 5) Bandit algorithms </li>
	</ul>
	</li>

	<li>Second Half: Economic Aspects for Machine Learning
	<ul>
		<li> (week 5-6) Information, valuation of information and data </li>
		<li> (week 7-8) Learning from strategic data sources and distribution shifting </li>
		<li> (week 9) Economics of generative AIs, human-vs-AI content creation competition </li>

	</ul>
	</li>
 </ul> 

This is primarily a theory course, and lecture-based. That said, we will focus on proofs and will not write code. Prerequisites include linear algebra, probability and algorithms. Familiarity to optimization is a plus but not necessary. Note that no background on game theory or learning theory is required.

	<h3>Requirements and Grading</h3>

Participation counts for 10%. Homework assignments will count for 45% of the grade. There will be 4 proof-based assignments, roughly 2 weeks apart each. While discussion among students is allowed, students must write up the solutions independently. 
</p>

The remaining 45% of the grade is allocated to a research project. Students can team up for the project and each team should consist of 2 to 4 people. The project needs to raise novel technical questions related to the course topics and provide some nontrivial answers.


</p>
There is no midterm or final for the course. 
</p>

<b>For those who take the course as elective</b>: this course can be taken as an elective. To do so, you will need to complete the 1-2 bonus (often more challenging) questions in each assignment. 

</p>
<b>Late Homework Policy </b>: Each student is allowed one late homework for at most two days from the due date. You may choose whichever homework to use this chance (or not use it). No additional late homework will be accepted.
</p>

<h3> Students with disabilities or learning needs </h3>
We thrive to create a learning experience that is as accessible as possible. If you anticipate any issues related to the format, materials, or requirements of this course, please meet with me outside of class so we can explore potential options. Students with disabilities may also wish to work with the UChicago Student Disability Services to discuss a range of options to removing barriers in this course, including official accommodations. Please visit their website for information on this process and to apply for services online: <a href="https://disabilities.uchicago.edu/">disabilities.uchicago.edu</a>. If you have already been approved for accommodations through SDS, please send me your accommodation letter, and meet with me if needed, so we can develop an implementation plan together.
