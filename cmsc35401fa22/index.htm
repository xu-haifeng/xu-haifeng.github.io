	<!-- <b>Prerequisites:</b> The pre-requisitive for CIS 322 is CIS 212 or equivalent. You may take CIS 322 concurrently with CIS 314 or CIS 313. It is preferable to take CIS 322 before CIS 330 and CIS 415, although it is not a pre-requisite. Students at the 400 level may take CIS 322, but you should be aware that the course is designed primarily for students at the 300 level.<br/><br/> -->

 <!-- 
  A printable version of lecture slides will generally be available online (in our Piazza site) within a day or two after the lecture. I do not make them available before class.

  <h3>Course Description</h3>
<p>Welcome! This is a graduate level course covering topics at the interface between machine learning and game theory. In many economic or game-theoretic applications, the problem either lacks sufficient data or is too complex. In such cases, machine learning theory helps to design more realistic or practical algorithms. Conversely, in many application of machine learning or prediction, the algorithms have to obtain data from self-interested agents whose objectives are not aligned with the algorithm designer. In those settings, the algorithms have to take into account these agents' strategic behaviors. These problems form an intriguing interplay between machine learning and game theory, and have attracted a lot of recent research attention. This course will discuss several recent research directions in this space. Our goal is to cover (some selected) basic results in the following four directions. Alone the way, we will also cover necessary basics to game theory, learning theory, mechanism design, prediction and information aggregation. 
</p>


<p>Topics covered in this course, and tentative syllabus: </p>
<ul>
	<li>First Half: Learning for Game Theory 
	<ul>
		<li> (week 1) Linear programming and duality</li>
		<li> (week 2-3) Intro to game theory, zero-sum games</li>
		<li> (week 3-4) No regret learning and its convergence to equilibrium</li>
		<li> (week 5) Bandit algorithms </li>
	</ul>
	</li>

	<li>Second Half: Game Theory for Learning
	<ul>
		<li> (week 5-6) Mechanisms for eliciting information: scoring rules and prediction markets</li>
		<li> (week 7) Bayesian persuasion, and pricing of information </li>
		<li> (week 8-9) Learning from strategic data sources </li>
		<li> (week 9) Fairness tradeoffs in prediction </li>

	</ul>
	</li>
 </ul> 

This is primarily a theory course, and lecture-based. That said, we will focus on proofs and will not write code. Prerequisites include linear algebra, probability and algorithms. Familiarity to optimization is a plus but not necessary. Note that no background on game theory or learning theory is required.

	<h3>Requirements and Grading</h3>

 Homework assignments will count for 50% of the grade. There will be 3 assignments, roughly 3 weeks apart each. The homework will be proof-based, and are intended to be very challenging. Collaboration and discussion among students is allowed, even encouraged. However, students must write up the solutions independently. The remaining 50% of the grade is allocated to a final project. Students can team up for the project and each team should consist of 2 to 4 people. The project can: (1) study a <i>research</i> problem relevant to the course (ideally, also related to your own research) and write a report about your research findings; or (2) survey a related research topic by reading papers in that area and write an overview report of the area. More detailed instructions will come later. 
<br> <br>
There is no midterm or final for the course. 
<br> <br>


<b>Late Homework Policy </b>: Each student is allowed one late homework for at most two days from the due date. You may choose whichever homework to use this chance (or not use it). No additional late homework will be accepted.  

<br>

<h3> Students with disabilities or learning needs </h3>
We thrive to create a learning experience that is as accessible as possible. If you anticipate any issues related to the format, materials, or requirements of this course, please meet with me outside of class so we can explore potential options. Students with disabilities may also wish to work with the UChicago Student Disability Services to discuss a range of options to removing barriers in this course, including official accommodations. Please visit their website for information on this process and to apply for services online: <a href="https://disabilities.uchicago.edu/">disabilities.uchicago.edu</a>. If you have already been approved for accommodations through SDS, please send me your accommodation letter, and meet with me if needed, so we can develop an implementation plan together.
