<b>Abstract. </b> Classical constraint satisfaction problems, such as 3SAT and MaxCut, have two important generalizations in quantum information. One leads to the Local Hamiltonian problem, and the other to Nonlocal Games. These frameworks hold fascinating physical and computational aspects. Computationally, the Local Hamiltonian problem naturally characterizes QMA (the quantum analogue of NP), while Nonlocal Games capture RE (the class of recursively enumerable languages containing all computable languages and more). From a physical perspective, Hamiltonians formalize interactions between particles in a quantum system, while Nonlocal Games encode the notion of quantum correlations. In this talk, I will explore these quantum CSPs, share recent results, and highlight several intriguing open problems. </p>

<b>Abstract. </b> Entanglement is the crucial phenomenon that distinguishes quantum systems from classical ones. Specifically, we consider entanglement in many-body systems at thermal equilibrium as a function of the temperature. Systems at thermal equilibrium at sufficiently low temperatures are demonstrably entangled. We investigate whether these systems remain entangled as the temperature increases.  
We prove that above a fixed constant temperature, the system does not exhibit any entanglement and behaves entirely classically. This proof of the sudden death of thermal entanglement cuts against a large body of prior work, both rigorous and computational, which only gives mild limits on entanglement at constant temperatures. Our proof falls out of a new connection between lack of entanglement and an algorithm for preparing thermal states on a quantum computer. <br> <p>
Based on joint work with Allen Liu, Ankur Moitra and Ewin Tang.

 <b>Abstract. </b> A fundamental technique for controlling capacity of learning models is "regularization," which trades off empirical risk with some measure of hypothesis complexity, though the term is applied liberally to a variety of explicit and implicit approaches with similar effect. Nevertheless, no such algorithmic technique or principle has broken away from the pack to characterize optimal learning in these more general settings. The purpose of this work is to precisely characterize the role of regularization in perhaps the simplest setting for which ERM fails: multiclass learning with arbitrary label sets. Using one-inclusion graphs (OIGs), we exhibit optimal learning algorithms that dovetail with tried-and-true algorithmic principles: Occam's Razor as embodied by structural risk minimization (SRM), the principle of maximum entropy, and Bayesian inference. We also introduce an optimal learner which relaxes structural risk minimization. <br> </p> 

This is joint work with Julian Asilis, Siddartha Devic, Vatsal Sharan, and Shang-Hua Teng, all at USC.  </p>

<b>Abstract. </b>  We initiate the study of Stochastic Online Correlated Selection (SOCS), a family of online rounding algorithms for the general Non-IID model of Stochastic Online Submodular Welfare Maximization and its special cases such as unweighted and vertex-weighted Online Stochastic Matching, Stochastic AdWords, and Stochastic Display Ads. Following this framework, we make progress on numerous problems such as online stochastic matching, query-commit matching, stochastic display ads and also answer two open questions related to AdWords: <br> <p> 
- Stochastic AdWords: We give a 0.6338 competitive algorithm for Stochastic AdWords, breaking the 1-1/e barrier for the first time, answering a decade-long open question  <br> <p>  

- AdWords: we get the first multi-way online correlated section (OCS) for AdWords, addressing an open question in the OCS literature.  </p>
